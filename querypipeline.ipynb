Eles são considerados fontes do direito e têm um papel fundamental na resolução de conflitos normativos. Quando há um conflito entre normas do Código Civil, os princípios gerais do direito podem ser utilizados para determinar qual norma deve prevalecer.

              "   'A doutrina e a analogia desempenham papéis importantes na resolução de lacunas legais, ou seja, quando há uma situação não prevista ou regulada de forma específica pela legislação.\\n\\nA doutrina consiste no conjunto de estudos, análises e interpretações realizadas por juristas, acadêmicos e especialistas do direito. Através da doutrina, são desenvolvidas teorias e argumentos que ajudam a compreender e interpretar as normas jurídicas. Quando há uma lacuna legal, a doutrina pode ser utilizada para preencher essa lacuna, oferecendo interpretações e soluções para o caso concreto. Os juristas podem recorrer a obras doutrinárias, artigos acadêmicos e opiniões de especialistas para embasar suas decisões e argumentações.\\n\\nA analogia, por sua vez, é um método de interpretação do direito que consiste em aplicar uma norma existente a uma situação semelhante que não está expressamente regulada pela legislação. A analogia busca encontrar uma solução para a lacuna legal através da aplicação de uma norma existente que seja semelhante em sua essência e finalidade. Para utilizar a analogia, é necessário que exista uma semelhança relevante entre a situação não regulada e a situação regulada pela norma existente.\\n\\nTanto a doutrina quanto a analogia são ferramentas utilizadas pelos juristas e operadores do direito para suprir as lacunas legais e garantir a aplicação adequada do direito em situações não previstas pela legislação. No entanto, é importante ressaltar que a utilização da doutrina e da analogia deve ser feita de forma criteriosa e fundamentada, levando em consideração os princípios gerais do direito e a finalidade da norma em questão.',\n",

Aqui estão algumas decisões relevantes:\\n\\n1. O Superior Tribunal de Justiça (STJ) divulgou 12 entendimentos sobre direitos da personalidade, destacando que o dano moral extrapatrimonial pode afetar tanto indivíduos quanto grupos ou coletividades. Esses entendimentos ajudam a orientar a interpretação e a aplicação dos direitos da personalidade em casos específicos.
